	<section class="cyberpunk"><p>Renewing the PSVita is a concept based on the failure of the console launched in 2011 by Sony. The goal is to bring the console back fixing the issues it had and adapting it to the innovations of these years. The design resembles the new PS5 and it adds portable earphones, made for the users to be more into the game even if they're out of their houses. </p></section>
